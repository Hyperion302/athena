through automatically you can decrease load on your admins and keep your members
happy!

## Features

## What's Ahead

Athena is the third name of a long running project.  It started as a
command-only bot, but it has evolved into a fully featured web-based
application.  

The most recent release was **Athena v2.0**.  It implemented the long-planned
Web Interface.

The next major release **v3.0** will bring:
* 100% (or as close to 100% Discord.JS will allow) feature-parity with native 
Discord moderation tools
* Quorums
* A voter role
